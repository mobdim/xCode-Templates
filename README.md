xCode-Templates
===============

Installation
------------

"make install" to install the templates. (You can "make uninstall" if you change your mind.) Relaunch Xcode, and you should see "OCUnit test case" with a green checkmark listed in the File Template Library in the Utilities pane â€” one for iOS, and one for OS X. You can also find them in the "New File" templates under Cocoa Touch and Cocoa.
